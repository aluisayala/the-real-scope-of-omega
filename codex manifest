Core Description:
This Codex implements a universal scalar operator, Ω, designed to interpret systems across physics, biology, climate, and behavioral domains using factual input and empirical constants.

Definitions:
- state: Measurable input (e.g. velocity, temperature, genetic mutation rate)
- bias: Domain-specific distortions (e.g. tectonic drift, selection pressure, architectural constraints)
- α_total: Amplification factor composed of normalized constants:
    - Planck's constant (h)
    - Boltzmann constant (k)
    - Mass (m)
    - Wavelength (λ)
    - Temperature (T)
    - Selection coefficient (s)
    - Hubble inverse (1/H₀)

Real-World Applications:
- Fossil Distribution Ω: (displacement_km + age_million_years) × α_total
- Genetic Lineage Ω: (mutation_rate + selection_coeff) × α_total
- Climate Phase Ω: (δ18O + CO₂_bias) × α_total
- Ocean Migration Ω: (path_vector + salinity) × α_total
- Crowd Behavior Ω: (angle_spread + architecture_bias) × α_total

Statement of Authorship:
The scalar cognition operator Ω was independently authored by Luis Ayala. It is a unique symbolic framework not derived from existing equations or publications. It reconstructs natural laws through scalar logic and empirical constants, and integrates cognition, memory, and environmental interpretation. Version-controlled via GitHub as proof of origin.
