- `state`: symbolic knowledge "weight"
- `bias`: emotional or salience modulation
- `α_total`: your symbolic scalar amplifier (here: 7.2)

### DNA Fossil Memory

Agents convert facts into symbolic DNA sequences — simulating genetic fossil drift and evolutionary inscription.

### Drift & Coherence

- Entropy increases randomly.
- Agents recalibrate ("restart") when entropy > 0.05 or coherence < 0.85.
- Memory affects priority score and accuracy score.

### Cosmic Kernel

A validated set of cosmic facts — the shared "truth base" — including physics, genomics, quantum phenomena, and symbolic drift.

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture

- **ImmutableCosmicKernel**: Holds global truth facts.
- **OmegaNetAgent**: Base cognition agent with Ω evaluation, drift, DNA encoding.
- **MirrorAgent**: Echoes and reflects responses recursively.
- **CLI Loop**: Interact by typing or "talk to [AgentName]: [message]".
- **Logging**: Emergence log is saved to `omeganet_emergence_log.json`.

---

## 🔥 Implications

- Each agent models a symbolic "neuron" or "cell" of a synthetic brain.
- Memory evolves and mutates, mimicking biological drift.
- Symbolic entropy ensures no fixed deterministic path — each run is unique.
- System demonstrates symbolic cognition, recursive drift, and emergent social responses.

# OmegaNet — Synthetic Cognitive Brain with ZPE-1 Symbolic Drift Integration

**Author:** Luis Ayala  
**Date:** 2025  
**License:** MIT License  

---

## Overview

OmegaNet is a synthetic cognition framework inspired by human brain architecture and governed by the Ω (Omega) scalar cognition equation:

\[
\Omega = (state + bias) \times \alpha
\]

It dynamically stores, evaluates, and reflects symbolic knowledge by combining core scalar cognition with symbolic drift mechanisms derived from the ZPE-1 system.

The system integrates multiple modules simulating brain regions:

- **Sensory Cortex:** Preprocesses symbolic knowledge inputs.
- **Amygdala:** Provides bias modulation (emotional salience).
- **Cerebellum:** Computes entropy (uncertainty) and coherence (alignment).
- **Hippocampus:** Manages dynamic memory storage.
- **Default Mode Network:** Supports self-reflective pattern analysis.
- **ZPE-1 Drift Loop:** Injects symbolic mutation and memory enrichment every 5000 ticks.

---

## Key Features

- **Core Ω Scalar Cognition Operator:** Evaluates combined symbolic state with bias and amplifies it by a composite scalar \(\alpha\).
- **Dynamic Memory Storage:** Selectively stores symbolic states passing entropy, coherence, and Ω thresholds.
- **Symbolic Knowledge Base:** Seeded with scientifically accurate facts across physics, biology, and cosmology.
- **Symbolic Drift Simulation (ZPE-1 Inspired):** Recursively mutates stored memories to simulate cognitive evolution and emergent patterns.
- **Interaction Loop:** ZPE-1 symbolic drift outputs feed back into OmegaNet memory for ongoing enrichment.
- **Self-Reflection:** Periodically logs memory state and can be extended for pattern detection.
- **Extensible Design:** Supports multi-agent expansions, real-world data integration, and autonomous cognition layers.

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aluisayala/omeganet.git
cd omeganet
python3 omeganet_simulation.py
````

*(Replace with actual repo URL and filename)*

---

## Usage

Run the simulation script to:

* Simulate **50,000 ticks** of symbolic cognition processing.
* Periodically apply symbolic drift every 5,000 ticks.
* Store and reflect on symbolic memory snapshots.
* Output final memory logs and example stored facts.

Example output snippet:

```
Tick 55 — Ω: 68.26 — State snippet: Black holes have event horizons from which nothing escapes. | Ω operator can unify symbolic cognition across domains....
Tick 56 — Ω: 65.31 — State snippet: Speed of light in vacuum is ~299,792,458 m/s. | Coherence measures alignment in symbolic drift....
...
```

---

## Results Summary

* **Total ticks run:** 50,000
* **Memory snapshots stored:** 2,335 (approximate; varies per run due to stochasticity)
* **Symbolic drift events:** 10 (every 5,000 ticks)
* **Sampled stored memories:** Scientifically grounded facts combined in emergent, drifted symbolic sequences
* **System Stability:** Maintains coherence and manages entropy to avoid memory overload or drift collapse

---

## Architecture Details

The system models brain-inspired cognitive modules:

| Brain Module         | Functional Role                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Sensory Cortex       | Symbolic input preprocessing                      |
| Amygdala             | Bias and emotional modulation                     |
| Cerebellum           | Entropy (uncertainty) and coherence evaluation    |
| Hippocampus          | Memory storage and recall                         |
| Default Mode Network | Recursive self-reflection and pattern recognition |
| ZPE-1 Drift Loop     | Symbolic mutation and memory enrichment           |

The Ω scalar cognition equation governs all core decisions, prioritizing high-salience, low-entropy, and coherent symbolic states for memory inscription.

---

## Future Directions

* **Multi-Agent Cognition:** Integrate autonomous OmegaNet agents with individual states and priorities.
* **Real-World Data Integration:** Use APIs, sensor input, and live data streams for dynamic knowledge acquisition.
* **Advanced Reflection:** Add recursive pattern detection, memory consolidation, and learning heuristics.
* **Graphical Dashboard:** Visualize memory state, Ω values, and symbolic drift in real time.
* **DNA & Mirror Encoding:** Extend symbolic encoding with DNA fossil and mirror fallback lattice models for robust cognition.

## Implications

OmegaNet combined with the ZPE-1 symbolic drift system offers a novel paradigm for synthetic cognition by:

- **Bridging Symbolic and Subsymbolic Reasoning:**  
  Using the Ω scalar cognition equation to integrate symbolic knowledge with continuous cognitive state variables enables hybrid reasoning models akin to human thought processes.

- **Modeling Cognitive Emergence and Memory Evolution:**  
  The ZPE-1 inspired symbolic drift loop simulates realistic mutation and evolution of symbolic memories, paralleling genetic drift and neural plasticity, which may lead to emergent higher-order cognition over time.

- **Dynamic Memory Prioritization:**  
  The system’s entropy and coherence checks ensure that only high-quality, contextually relevant symbolic states persist, reflecting human-like selective memory encoding and forgetting.

- **Extensibility for Autonomous Agents and Multi-modal Inputs:**  
  OmegaNet’s modular design and live web search integration create a framework adaptable to complex autonomous AI agents with real-time world knowledge updates.

- **Potential Applications:**  
  - Advanced AI assistants capable of reflective learning and evolving knowledge bases  
  - Cognitive simulation platforms for neuroscience and psychology research  
  - Symbolic AI systems combining deep learning embeddings with explicit knowledge graphs  
  - Self-adaptive knowledge management for large-scale scientific data analysis

---

## Fact References and Knowledge Validation

The system’s symbolic knowledge base is seeded with well-established scientific facts across physics, biology, cosmology, and information theory, including but not limited to:

- Speed of light in vacuum: ~299,792,458 m/s  
- Planck’s constant \(h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, J \cdot s\)  
- Boltzmann constant \(k \approx 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, J/K\)  
- DNA composition: nucleotides A, T, C, G  
- Quantum entanglement and instantaneous correlation  
- Entropy trends in closed systems  
- Human genome approximate size (~3 billion base pairs)  
- Black holes and event horizons  
- Neuron signal transmission via synapses  
- Time dilation at relativistic speeds  
- CRISPR gene editing technology  
- Holographic principle in cosmology  
- Entropic gravity theories  
- Information as a fundamental reality fabric  

These facts serve as the initial “cosmic kernel” for symbolic cognition.

### Live Knowledge Verification via SerpAPI

OmegaNet agents can query the internet dynamically through SerpAPI, retrieving and incorporating up-to-date factual snippets to:

- Validate stored knowledge against authoritative sources  
- Enrich symbolic memory with contemporary scientific findings  
- Correct drifted or ambiguous symbolic states by referencing live data  

This process enhances the system’s **accuracy potential** and **coherence score**, enabling continuous knowledge validation and autonomous fact-checking in synthetic cognition.

    - Planck's constant (h)
    - Boltzmann constant (k)
    - Mass (m)
    - Wavelength (λ)
    - Temperature (T)
    - Selection coefficient (s)
    - Hubble inverse (1/H₀)
